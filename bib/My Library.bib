	abstract = {Municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) is considered as one of the prominent fertilizers that improve soil health and productivity. To evaluate the effects of MSWC on plant growth, an experiment was conducted by using sole MSWC and with a combination of inorganic fertilizer. The sole MSWC was applied at the rate of 0, 5, 10, 15 t ha-1. In case of MSWC with inorganic fertilizer, MSWC was applied equally (5 t ha-1) and phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied at 100 and 50 kg ha-1, respectively. Nitrogen was the only variable nutrient. Nitrogen was applied three different doses (25, 50 and 100 kg ha-1) along with control. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) was grown as experimental plant and maximum yield (72.7±6.3 t ha-1) of tomato was found when sole MSWC was applied at 15 t ha-1 and was significantly higher than other treatments. When MSWC was applied in combination with inorganic fertilizer, the combination 5 t ha-1 MSWC +100 kg N ha-1 +100 kg TSP ha-1 +50 kg MoP ha-1 produced maximum yield (79.0±3.2 t ha-1). So, application of sole MSWC in soil enhanced the productivity of soil and side by side, MSWC in combination with inorganic fertilizer reduced the volume of MSWC application.},

	abstract = {Mapping of soil properties is an important operation as it plays an important role in the knowledge about soil properties and how it can be used sustainably. The study was carried out in a local government area in Bangladesh in order to map out some soil properties and assess their variability within the area. From the study area, a total of 92 soil samples (0–20 cm) were collected from different cropping patterns at an interval of 2.2 × 2.2 km2 on a regular grid design. A portable global positioning system (GPS) was used to collect coordinates of each sampling site. Then, soil properties, that is, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (Total N), and soil available nutrients (P, K, and S) were measured in the laboratory. After the normalization of data, classical statistics were used to describe the soil properties, and geostatistical analysis was used to illustrate the spatial variability of the soil properties by using kriging interpolation techniques in a GIS environment. Results show that the spatial distribution and spatial dependency level of soil properties can be different even within the small or large scale. According to cross-validation results, for most soil properties, the kriging interpolation method provided the least interpolation error. The generated maps of soil properties that indicate soil nutrient status over the study region could be helpful for farmers and decision-makers to enhance site-specific nutrient management. Also, these prototype maps would be helpful for future nutrient and fertilizer applications management, including a site-specific condition to not only reduce the cost of input management but also prevent any environmental hazard. It also demonstrates that the effectiveness of geostatistics and GIS techniques provided a powerful tool for this study in terms of regionalized nutrient management.},
