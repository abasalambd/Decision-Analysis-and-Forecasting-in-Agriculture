	abstract = {Fighting climate change and its nefarious effects is at the forefront of the United Nations\&rsquo; SDGs, agenda 2030. This comes at a time when the global climate is changing rapidly owing to increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere resulting principally from fossil fuel combustion and agricultural lands taking the place of tropical forests. Climate change threatens human existence in general and the livelihood of smallholder farmers in particular in the 21st century. Research shows that the developing world has about 500 million small-scale farms, with almost two billion people implicated, a majority of them in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where small-scale farms produce about 80\% of the food consumed. Hence, smallholder farmers will bear the greatest brunt of predicted changes in climatic patterns owing to their limited adaptive capacity. Small-scale farmers being appallingly vulnerable, easily succumb to climate-induced extreme weather events, thus threatening food security. It is therefore within this backdrop that the necessity to document and promote climate-smart, sustainable, productive and low cost agricultural practices becomes incumbent. Agroforestry is one of the few existing practices that contribute simultaneously to agricultural sustainability enhancement as well as improved farm productivity owing to its ability to provide many ecosystem services. There are currently very few existing agricultural practices where sustainable agricultural goals can be attained through simultaneous enhancement of agro-ecosystem diversity and farm productivity as in agroforestry systems. Today, few studies have looked into the contribution of agroforestry to beefing up agricultural sustainability and productivity in the context of climate change. This review paper therefore sought to research on what has been done so far as well as look into the way forward with focus on sub-Saharan Africa.

	Key words: Climate change, agroforestry practices, agricultural sustainability, agricultural productivity, sub-Saharan Africa

	abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is a key food security crop in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). Maize yield gaps are large in the smallholder farming systems of ESA but can be closed by a combination of improved crop varieties and sustainable cropping systems. On-farm trials were conducted in five countries of ESA over a seven-year period to assess the effects of different cropping systems on maize productivity. Cropping systems tested were conventional practice (Conv\_sole) compared with variants of conservation agriculture (CA) such as sole maize (CA\_sole), intercropping (CA\_intercropping) and rotation (CA\_rotation). Maize yield varied with cropping system and agro-ecological conditions. In highlands, CA\_intercropping (3709 kg ha−1) outperformed Conv\_sole (3456 kg ha−1), CA\_sole (3596 kg ha−1) and CA\_rotation (3545 kg ha−1) with similar legumes in the cropping system. The CA\_rotation (3050 kg ha−1) out-yielded the other treatments (2645−2864 kg ha−1) in lowlands where similar legumes were grown in the cropping system. Without rotation practices, CA\_sole (3596 kg ha−1) outperformed the conventional and CA\_intercropping treatments (2954−3036 kg ha−1) in highlands with similar legumes in the cropping system. In lowlands, CA\_intercropping (2802 kg ha−1) out yielded the other treatments (2485−2658 kg ha−1). The highest maize yield was from CA systems with groundnut (3609 kg ha−1) and common bean (3307−3576 kg ha−1) under rotation and intercropping practices, respectively. Maize-pigeon pea intercropping (35 \%) and maize-groundnut rotation (31–43 \%) under CA had the highest maize yield advantages over the conventional practices. The most stable maize yields were from the maize-common bean systems under CA. There is scope for promoting CA cropping systems integrated with grain and forage legumes to address maize productivity challenges on smallholder farms of ESA.},
