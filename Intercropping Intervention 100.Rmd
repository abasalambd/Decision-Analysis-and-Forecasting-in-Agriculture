# Introduction

Agricultural productivity is declining in many regions globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa being particularly affected due to the combined impacts of climate change, unsustainable farming practices, and land fragmentation. In Kitui County, Kenya, located in the semi-arid region of Eastern Kenya, these challenges are further compounded by erratic rainfall patterns and recurrent droughts. Smallholder farmers in the region predominantly rely on rainfed maize monoculture systems. Due to high levels of poverty, most farmers are unable to afford synthetic fertilizers; among those who do, excessive and inappropriate use has contributed to soil acidification and nutrient imbalances, further reducing land productivity.  The proposed intervention includes the application of intercropping systems involving maize with nitrogen-fixing legumes (yellow beans and cowpeas) as cover crops , while acknowledging the inherent risks associated with pest and disease outbreaks, extreme climate events, all of which can impact overall profitability and the success of crop sales. These practices are intended to improve soil organic matter, enhance nutrient cycling, and increase resilience to climatic variability. However, the adoption of these practices poses a critical decision-making challenge for smallholder farmers, who are currently at a crossroads, uncertain whether to transition to Intercropping practices or continue relying on the conventional maize monoculture system. This report presents a comparative decision analysis of these two systems using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

## Decision Context

Primary Decision: Should smallholder farmers adopt regenerative agriculture practices, specifically intercropping with soil organic amendments, or continue with conventional maize monoculture?
Decision Makers: Smallholder farmers in Kitui County, Kenya 
Key Stakeholders: Peer farmers, local government authorities, community-based organizations, agricultural extension officers, and policymakers in the agricultural sector
Project duration: 7 years, encompassing phases of introduction, scaling, monitoring, and evaluation of the  intervention
Farm Size: 10 acres 

## Objectives
- To estimate the net present value (NPV) and profitability of maize monoculture and legume+maize intercropping over a 7-year period.
- To analyze risks associated with pests, climate variability, and market fluctuations.
- To assess which variables most influence decision-making through EVPI (Expected Value of Perfect Information).

#  Data and Inputs

We begin by loading the input parameters from a CSV file. This table should include means, coefficients of variation, and correlation structure for seed costs, yields, prices, pest/disease risks, climate event probabilities, and other cost items.

```{r load-inputs}
# Read the unified input table
input_data <- read.csv("data/Input_File.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Convert to decisionSupport estimate object
estimates <- as.estimate(input_data)
```

#  Monte Carlo Simulation Model

##  Sampling Function

We define a helper to draw a single Monte Carlo sample and assign variables in the global environment.

```{r sampling-func}
make_variables <- function(est, n = 1) {
  x <- random(rho = est, n = n)
  for (nm in colnames(x)) {
    assign(nm, as.numeric(x[1, nm]), envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
}
# Draw initial sample (for testing purposes)
make_variables(estimates)
```

##  Core Model Function

The `model_function()` computes time-series of costs, revenues, cashflows, and NPVs for both monoculture and intercropping scenarios over the planning horizon (`n_years`).

# Discussion

The findings from this decision analysis overwhelmingly support intercropping as a financially superior and more robust agricultural practice compared to monoculture. The substantial and sustained increase in both annual and cumulative profits, along with the higher NPV distribution for intercropping, presents a compelling economic case for its adoption. 
This financial advantage can be attributed to the inherent benefits of diversification, which include reduced risk from single crop failure, more efficient utilization of resources (e.g., land, water, nutrients), and potential for improved soil health over time.The analysis of different cashflow scenarios further refines these insights. 
The Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) scores provide critical strategic insights for optimizing intercropping systems in Kitui County (Figure7). The importance of Cowpea and Yellow Beans prices and yields cannot be overlooked. The significant VIP score for Reduction of Sales for Post Harvest loses underscores that even with high yields, economic benefits can be lost due to poor post-harvest practices. Interventions focusing on appropriate drying, storage, and processing technologies are vital to minimize losses.
The monoculture scenario (Figure 4) demonstrates its vulnerability, where price fluctuations pose a major threat to profitability, as indicated by the high importance of Price(USD\Kg) and its high EVPI. This suggests that monoculture systems are highly sensitive to market volatility, emphasizing the need for robust price forecasting or risk mitigation strategies

# Conclusion
Based on the robust decision analysis and simulation results, the proposed intercropping intervention, integrating maize with nitrogen-fixing legumes (yellow beans and cowpeas), is strongly recommended for implementation in Kitui County, Kenya. This system demonstrably offers significantly higher annual and cumulative profits and a superior Net Present Value compared to traditional monoculture, indicating a pathway to improved farmer livelihoods and agricultural sustainability in the region.
